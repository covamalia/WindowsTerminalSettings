# Windows Terminal Settings

My Windows Terminal settings

Has the following settings:

- custom settings.json
- some logos referenced in settings.json (and some gifs too, coming soon I hope!)
- Setup script to set up settings.json, logos and gifs
- Powershell profile (will need to be added to your profile manually, but the code should install missing dependencies) to set up oh-my-posh, posh-git and Terminal-Icons, as well as print out a nice Windows icon to the console window.

Has been tested on my machines and works. Setup script backs up settings.json and RoamingState before placing these ones in the right places. Be aware of whats running though.
